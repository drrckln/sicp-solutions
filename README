These are my solutions to the problems contained in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, second edition.

This is the base of my attempt to learn programming. Previously, I have learnt little bits of Python, R, Scheme, and Haskell. However I haven't been comfortable making any sort of program.

I'm making a first pass through the old videos, which can be found at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/. As of this time of writing, I've finished video 7b. 8a is getting a bit too far away from me, so I'm going to start actually doing the problems to solidify my knowledge.

If you're attempting to do something similar, please don't get discouraged! I took a shot at the videos months ago and couldn't make it past 2a.
