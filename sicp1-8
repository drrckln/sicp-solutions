Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value

((x/y^2) + 2y)/3

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)


; test and improve
(define (cbrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess (improve guess x))
      guess
      (cbrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

; alternate strategy of comparing improved guess to previous guess
(define (good-enough? guess improved-guess)
  (< (abs (/ (- improved-guess guess) guess)) 0.0000000000000000001))

; Newton's method for cube roots
(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (* 2 guess)
        (/ x (square guess)))
     3))

; starts off
(define (cbrt x)
  (cbrt-iter 1.0 x))
